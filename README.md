🌊 Fusion Flood Alert v2.0
Fusion Flood Alert is a hyper-local early warning system designed to replace reactive flood monitoring with proactive AI prediction. Unlike traditional models that rely on a single data point, this system utilizes a 4-Signal Ensemble approach to minimize false alarms.

Key Features:

🧠 Multi-Modal Prediction: Combines Deep Learning (LSTM) with Hydrological Physics (HSI) and Satellite Imagery (Sentinel-1).

⏳ Extended Lead Time: Provides actionable warnings up to 96 hours in advance (vs. the standard 24 hours).

🖥️ Role-Based Dashboards: Dedicated interfaces for Government Officials (Command Center), Engineers (Technical Monitor), and Rescue Teams (Satellite Map).

🚀 Scalable Architecture: Containerized microservices built on FastAPI and PostgreSQL, ready for MeghRaj/AWS deployment.
