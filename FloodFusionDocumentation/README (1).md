## **KEY TALKING POINTS**

### **When Someone Asks: "Why Your Solution?"**

Use **02_solution_overview.md** to explain:
- ❌ LSTM alone = black box + late warnings
- ✅ Your 4 signals = transparent + early warnings + actionable guidance

### **When Someone Asks: "What About C-FLOOD?"**

Use **02_solution_overview.md** ending:
- C-FLOOD excellent for 3 basins, 48-hour lead
- Your system adds 25 basins, extends to 96-hour lead
- Together: Complete nationwide coverage

### **When Someone Asks: "Cost?"**

Use **04_tech_stack_setup.md** section:
- ₹0.8 crore setup
- ₹0.75 crore/year operations
- Saves ₹400-750 crore/year
- ROI: 531:1

### **When Someone Asks: "Can It Work?"**

Use **05_interactive_dashboards.md** + demo:
- "Here are working prototypes"
- "We have real 4-signal logic"
- "See the actual UX for officials"

---

## **BONUS: PITCH SCRIPTS**

### **Opening Hook (First 10 seconds):**

"In 2019, Kerala floods killed 124 people. Not because warnings don't exist. But because warnings came too late. Only 24 hours to evacuate 100,000 people. Impossible.

**I built a system that gives 96 hours advance notice instead of 24.**"

### **Problem Statement (Next 20 seconds):**

"India has 28 major river basins. Government AI monitors only 3. That means 25 basins have ZERO early warning system. 400-600 people die every year from preventable floods."

### **Solution Elevator Pitch (Next 30 seconds):**

"I use 4 complementary AI signals working together:
1. LSTM learns weather patterns
2. Physics equation measures river stress
3. CatBoost classifies risk + shows why
4. Satellite confirms with actual water maps

Result: 96-hour warning, not 24-hour. Transparent, not black box. Actionable, not just a number."

2. **Solution**: "Why 4 signals instead of 1 model?" → See 02_solution_overview.md
3. **Implementation**: "What exactly will you build?" → See 03_dashboards_guide.md
4. **Technology**: "How does it technically work?" → See 04_tech_stack_setup.md
5. **Viability**: "Can you actually build this?" → See 05_interactive_dashboards.md (working code!)
